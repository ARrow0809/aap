Two teenage girls. One is Japanese with an oval face, messy ash brown short hair with light blue highlights, deep sapphire blue eyes, wearing blue light blocking glasses, a black t-shirt with a React logo, a navy zip-up hoodie, denim hot pants, white knee-highs with absolute territory, a USB drive necklace, and large noise-cancelling headphones, in a slightly hunched posture, like a programmer and AI enthusiast. The other has bright blonde, loose wavy long hair with a side braid, sparkling hazel eyes, gyaru makeup, a white crop top, a plaid mini skirt, platform sneakers, wearing Pixel Buds as earrings and Pixel Watch accessories, holding a Pixel smartphone, with Google color nails, like a digital native gyaru. DSLR quality, featuring Google colors in the scene. --ar 16:9 --v 6.0
