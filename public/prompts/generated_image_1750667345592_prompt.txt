A line art illustration featuring a slim Korean figure with twin tails, wearing a T-shirt and hood. Their front-facing face has a sad, slightly pouty and sulky expression. The figure is quietly or wistfully waving. In the background is a vast sky, with natural light creating beautiful lens flares that bleed onto the canvas.
