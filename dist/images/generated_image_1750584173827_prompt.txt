A photorealistic DSLR-quality night shot capturing the Neo-Shibuya Center Street with a Dutch angle. The slick pavement beneath mirrors bold reflections of Google reds, blues, yellows, and greens. In the left foreground, a young female coder with short ash-brown hair tipped light blue, sapphire eyes visible behind blue-light glasses, crouches clutching her head in quiet despair. She wears a React tee under a navy hoodie, denim hot-pants, and white knee-high socks that expose zettai ryoiki. Her USB-stick necklace and oversized noise-canceling headphones catch the vibrant neon reflections from the street. Beside her, a young female with a long light-blonde side-braid, hazel eyes, and gal makeup with Google-colored nails beams a peace sign toward the lens. She is dressed in a white crop top, a plaid miniskirt, chunky platform sneakers, and accessorized with Pixel Buds earrings, a glittering Pixel Watch, and holds a softly glowing Pixel phone. Vibrant rim-lighting and shallow depth-of-field isolate this duo against the backdrop of towering holographic billboards in the evening Neo-Shibuya Center Street
