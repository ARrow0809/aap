In an 8-bit pixel art world, a room unfolds with a wide, distorted view as if captured by a fisheye lens. A full moon hangs outside the window, casting soft light. In the center sits a young man, shown in full view. He has a round face, short bangs, and vibrant blue hair. Despite his toned physique, he wears what appears to be a kimono layered with a hood. Seated and looking slightly downwards, his eyes are closed. His pixelated expression conveys worry and anxiety, with furrowed brows and a downward-curved mouth showing distress. Although bathed in moonlight, his troubled expression remains.
